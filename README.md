# EMA VWAP Crossover Buy Signals

A **TradingView Pine Script** indicator designed for **low-risk, high-reward scalping setups**.  
Best used on **3-minute candlesticks**, this tool combines **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)** with **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)** and multiple support band levels to pinpoint high-probability **buy entries** during intraday trading.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Not recommended for use during low-volume periods or algo-dominated trading sessions, as signals may be unreliable in thin markets.

3. **Signal Classification**:
   - **Band 1‚Äì2** = mild oversold, early signal
   - **Band 2‚Äì3** = deeper oversold, stronger signal
   - **Below Band 3** = extreme oversold, highest conviction
4. **Stop-Loss Marking**:
   - If price drops by a set amount after signal, label as ‚ÄúWRONG‚Äù for trade review.
